## Description:
Instant XP Gain is a server-side mod designed for both performance and convenience. It removes the generation of XP orbs during gameplay and directly grants XP to players, eliminating the need to collect orbs manually. By bypassing XP orb creation, this mod not only optimizes server performance by reducing entity load but also simplifies gameplay by removing the hassle of retrieving scattered XP.

Key features:

  - Instantly grants XP from villager trades, smelting, cooking, killing mobs, players and block breaking.

  - Helps optimize server performance and prevents abuse of XP-based lag machines.

  - Fully compatible with Mending and other vanilla mechanics that depend on XP.

  - Does not remove the XP drop from defeating the Ender Dragon. Collecting this XP is part of the challenge, and distributing it equally ensures fairness in multiplayer environments.

Whether you're running a small private server or a large multiplayer world, Instant XP Gain helps streamline gameplay while maintaining balance, fairness, while improving performance.

Development plans: Planned updates include the prevention of XP generation from sources like grindstones, fishing, breeding animals and XP bottles, further streamlining gameplay and reducing server strain to make Instant XP Gain even more versatile for optimized server performance. Once a richer, feature-complete, and bug-free version of the mod is achieved, it will also be released for additional Minecraft versions.

This is my first mod, so bugs are expected.

Please note that full compatibility with mods that introduce new methods of obtaining XP or alter the behavior of existing XP mechanics may not be guaranteed.
