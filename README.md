## Description:
Instant XP Gain is a mod designed for both performance and convenience. It removes the generation of XP orbs during gameplay and directly grants XP to players, eliminating the need to collect orbs manually. By bypassing XP orb creation, this mod not only optimizes game performance by reducing entity load but also simplifies gameplay by removing the hassle of retrieving scattered XP.

Key features:

  - Instantly grants XP to the player from every source of the game!

  - Helps optimize server and client performance.

  - It prevents the abuse of XP-based lag machines.

  - Fully compatible with vanilla mechanics that depend on XP.

  - Does not remove the XP drop from defeating the Ender Dragon since distributing it equally ensures fairness in multiplayer environments.

Whether you're playing in a singleplayer world or managing your server, Instant XP Gain helps streamline gameplay while maintaining balance, fairness, and improving performance.

This mod has full compatibility with most mods that introduce new mechanics reguarding XP or alter existing ones.

I will soon release this mod for additional Minecraft versions and make it client-side too. To stay up to date for future updates and releases, consider following this mod!
